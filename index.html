<h1>Memory Card Game</h1>
<h2> Instructions></h2>
    <p>Pick a card, then guess where the matching card is. If you find the matching card you keep both cards and go again. If you do not get the matching card you flip both cards back over and your opponent goes. Be sure to  pay attention to the placement of all cards when they are flipped over! The person with the most matches after the last 2 cards are collected is the winner.</p>
